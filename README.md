# oxfordLakeStatus2Lipd

This repository will contain code to convert the Oxford Lake Status database into LiPD files, probably with some added metadata and calibrating the 14C dates. The original data came from ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/paleolimnology/lakelevels/oxford/ and were collated into a netcdf file by Michael Erb. This code starts there.

Feel free to reuse any part of this code, it may be useful for those looking to convert a database into LiPD.
